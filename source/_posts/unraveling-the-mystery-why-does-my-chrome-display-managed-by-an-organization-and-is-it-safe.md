## What is “Managed by your organization”?

“Managed by your organization” is a Google Chrome feature that lets the organization managers control the Chrome browser settings and policies for the employees working in their business.

According to their company policies, the managers can set many types of restrictions through Chrome policies like blacklisting social media sites on work computers, printing restrictions, force install Chrome web extensions, and more.

On Chromebook, “Managed by your organization” can do much more. It can restrict which USB devices can be accessed from web apps.

## Why Chrome is Showing “Managed by your Organization”?

As it is clear, this feature is generally for the organizations or groups applied by the group manager or leader to restrict the employees’ web activities. Although, in many cases, the message “Your browser is managed by your organization” appears even on the browser of the users who are not associated with any organization.

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrome-mange-by-org-message.png)

There could be several reasons for that, both legitimate and illegitimate.

The legitimate reason could be because of changes effective from **Chrome version 73**. From Chrome 73, if the software programs have set the enterprise policies, you will likely to receive the “Managed by your Organization” message. So, most of the home users receive this message from Chrome because of changes in Chrome.

However, some home users may also receive that message because a malware program has taken control of their Chrome browser and is modifying its settings without user permission. Some potentially unwanted applications (PUAs) like [browser hijackers](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) may get an entry on your browser and alter its settings.

## How to Remove the message?

If the message is appearing on your Chrome browser because of malicious browser hijacker, then [it is vital to remove it](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) from your system as soon as possible. It is because, by changing your browser’s settings, the browser hijacker can perform many malicious tasks such as changing the home page, default search engine, and also promote illegitimate web pages or search engines.

Here is how you can remove the message from Chrome if it causes by Chrome policies:
