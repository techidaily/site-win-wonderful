## 10 thoughts on ‚ÄúJava Security Issues ‚Äì How to Fix‚Äù

1. ‚ÄúIf you use Java for a desktop app or to play Minecraft, disable the browser plug-in‚Äù I was done at that point, die hard Minecraft fan hahaha.  
[Reply](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)  
   * Same here. I think that this applies for most people who use Java, Minecraft is one of the main reasons that people install Java anyways lol.  
   [Reply](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)  
   * All hail the Mineraft master race.  
   [Reply](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)
2. I think that one of the main reasons that makes Java such a good target for hackers, is the number of people that are using them. Creating a virus for Java should dramatically increases the chances of a hacker in succeeding to hack someone as the number of potential targets increases a lot.  
[Reply](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)  
   * Of course it is a good reason, the more people who use the application that you are creating a virus with, the higher your chances of infecting someone.

3. I can almost guarantee that everyone stopped reading after the Minecraft part üòõ

   * Die hard Minecraft fans hahaha.  
   [Reply](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)  
   * Yep, no doubt about it.

4. Cyber criminals making $60.000 a week? It‚Äôs hard to believe something like that.  
[Reply](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)  
   * You think that this is a lot? Check out the ransomware virus then and tell me if that changed your mind.
