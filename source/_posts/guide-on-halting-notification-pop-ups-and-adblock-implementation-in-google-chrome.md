This request appears beside the address field where the lock icon appears. You can close this request by pressing the cross button but next time you open that website, it will again appear. You will know in this section how to stop this request permanently from all websites. No website could ask you to show notifications.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

To eliminate the Marketing Overlays, we will be taking help of an extension, follow these simple steps:

Open [Poper Blocker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pop-up-blocker-for-chrome/bkkbcggnhapdmkeljlodobbkopceiche) in the Chrome Web store and click on **Add to Chrome**.

![Poper Blocker Extension](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Poper-Blocker-Extension.jpg)

Let the extension install and it will start working just after the installation.

I tested this extension on five different websites with different overlay types:

* Navigate away from the page
* Pop up in the corner
* Appear when the page loads up

Out of all the sites, Poper Blocker was able to block the pop-ups on about four of them.

There isn’t a perfect solution to get rid of all the overlays and pop-ups. However, Poper Blocker would certainly help you a lot to prevent most of them and provide you a smooth browsing experience.

## 4- Block Auto-Playing Videos on Chrome

One day you are listening to your favorite music with full volume on laptop speaker. The other day you are trying to focus on your work and visit a business website with an auto-playing video. The laptop is still at full volume. Wouldn’t it just catch you by surprise?

Auto-playing videos sometimes turn out to be frustrating. Additionally, they slow down your page load speed. To prevent the videos on any website from auto-playing, you just need to follow these simple steps:

Open [AutoplayStopper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/autoplaystopper/ejddcgojdblidajhngkogefpkknnebdh) extension in Chrome web store and click on **Add to Chrome** button.

Once the extension install, it will start stopping videos from auto-playing. Though, you can add exceptions if you want some pages to auto-play videos. Click on the extension and enter the URL.

## 5- Unroll Paginated Articles on Chrome

Imagine reading the “Top 50 Food Joints in China” article where you have click for about 50 times to learn about all the food joints. Now imagine reading the same details mentioned in a single page without requiring to click numerous times.

To unroll these paginated articles, install the Evernote extension available on Google Chrome Web Store. To install the extension, follow these simple steps:

Open [Evernote](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/evernote-web-clipper/pioclpoplcdbaefihamjohnefbikjilc) extension in Chrome web store and click on **Add to Chrome** button.

![Evernote Web Clipper Extension](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Evernote-Web-Clipper-Extension.jpg)

This app saves a lot of time by only displaying all the details on a single page. You don’t even require to spend a lot of time and waste your clicks on the Paginated Articles.
