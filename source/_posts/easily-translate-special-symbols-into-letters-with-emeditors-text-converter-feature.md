hello!  
 I currently work with turkish text and I need an automatic way to convert all special turkish characters into their corresponding english/latin characters  
 because I often work with other than english languages that have special characters, I need a way to convert them to their english/latin character analogue  
 but for now, a solution for turkish?  
 thanks!

Hi,  
 I guess it could be done by macro:  
 – start “record macro”,  
 – replace one special character to the corresponding latin character (replace all)  
 – stop record  
 – “edit” the macro recored, copy all code generated by emeditor and paste it else where.  
 – repeat the procedure above with each special character you want to replace, except append the generated macro code to the first one.  
 – save the cumulated code to a single macro, put it in toolbar or asign it a short-cut key.  
 Best regards! :-)

Hi user,  
 As ToadLoadin mentioned, you can use a macro to do this.  
 Also, you can use the Batch Replace feature of EmEditor Professional 11 to do this task easily.

thanks, I will try macro, but I am interested in batch replace too  
 however, is it possible to save a specific batch and run it by clicking a button in the toolbar?

Hi user,  
 Unfortunately, it is not easy to create a button from a batch you create from the Batch Replace feature. I might think about exporting as a macro from the Batch Replace dialog in future versions. Thanks!

Participant  
can anyone write a JS script or something that will do these replaces with a click of a button?  
 i for ı  
 g for ğ  
 s for ş  
 c for ç  
 u for ü  
 o for ö  
 case sensitive, in all document, every instance  
 thanks!

Hello,  
 You could actually record a macro while doing the batch replace.  
 The actual script will look like:  
document.selection.Replace("a","b",eeFindNext | eeFindSaveHistory | eeFindReplaceEscSeq | eeReplaceAll | eeFindReplaceQuiet);  
	document.selection.Replace("c","d",eeFindNext | eeFindSaveHistory | eeFindReplaceEscSeq | eeReplaceAll | eeFindReplaceQuiet);  
	...  
	 Thanks,

Participant  
it seems to work very well, thanks!  
 but how do I specify the case-sensitive action?

I guess while recording the macro, if you turned case sensitive on, it will also be recored into the macro code.

Hi all,  
 1) What command should be used for removing a character?  
 2) How to replace double (or more) empty lines with a single empty line?  
 Thank you!

Yutaka,  
 I have just used this technique to write a snippet/macro that changes curly quotes (single and double), sort and long dashes into their equivalent keyboard characters.  
 In the past I have had to do this as a series of “Find and Replace” tasks. Now its a simple highlight the text and click on the snippet.  
 Thank you very much for the tip.  
 Regards,  
 Peter :-D

Thank you!  
 Now how is it possible to remove double (or more) empty lines?  
 Thank you again for any response!

:-) I think it could be done with this macro:  
// If nothing selected, select all.  
	var currentSelection = getSelection();  
	    
	// A find'n replace using regular expression  
	// (in selected range only).  
	currentSelection.Replace("^s*$n", "", eeReplaceSelOnly | eeReplaceAll | eeFindReplaceRegExp);  
	    
	// earase search keyword highlighting.  
	document.HighlightFind = false;  
 Then, you could use this macro to insert empty lines between each “none-empty” line (forgive my poor english):  
// If nothing selected, select all.  
	var currentSelection = getSelection();  
	    
	// A find'n replace using regular expression  
	// (in selected range only).  
	currentSelection.Replace("n", "nn", eeReplaceSelOnly | eeReplaceAll | eeFindReplaceRegExp);  
	    
	// earase search keyword highlighting.  
	document.HighlightFind = false;

I just found that both of the two macro above is not perfect due to lack of checking the setting whether “**regular expressions can match new line characters**” or not…
