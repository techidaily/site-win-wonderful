## The definition of Hacking

Before we get down to the list of programs, it’s worth defining what we actually mean by hacking, in this particular instance. In the simplest of terms, hacking is the process of taking control of your system either by suspicious or malicious means.

Hackers these days have employed different ways to gain access to your file sand steal your data. Once in, these cybercriminals can spy on all your activity in real-time, as well as hijack valuable computer resources like processing power, memory and hard drive space. They can even damage or encrypt sensitive information and personal files using ransomware crypto locker ransomware. Most hack attempts also install backdoors in order to get access to your PC.

If all this sounds familiar and scary, then there is a solid bet that you have installed some form of protection on your devices. These can be in the shape of good old [Windows Defender](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/comprehensive-security), third-party antivirus programs from companies like [McAfee](https://www.mcafee.com/) and [Kaspersky](https://www.kaspersky.com/), or even antimalware applications [Malwarebytes Anti-Malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/antiexploit/) and [MalwareFox](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/).

Having a reputable antivirus solution is the first line of defense against hackers, and go a long way in ensuring that your computer remains as far as possible from scenarios that may lead to hacks and hack attempts from malicious actors.

But this is not true in every case.

For modern and advanced hackers work with newer form of malware that ether disables or eludes security solutions very easily. Another layer of protection, either manual or automatic, in the form of anti-hacking software may just be what the doctor ordered.

## Is there such a thing as an anti-hacking software?

The first question from the public is that is there actually anti-hacking software? One that specifically prevents hack attempts and warns you whenever someone is found snooping around your computer? It’s a complicated answer, for advanced hardware and enterprise solutions do exist that help with this.

However, for most users, there is no such thing as anti-hacking software. At least, not a dedicated one that actively monitors suspicious and malicious activities on your system.

What we have are programs that have these capabilities built into them. These are designed to help protect your computer from hackers and detect malicious code on your system like malware and spyware that makes your device vulnerable to cyberattacks and hacking attempts. In other words, these programs keep your system safe from hackers, and so can be loosely labeled as anti-hacking software.

No there is no software that can make your computer threat-proof, no program that can detect and remove all kind of malicious threats. The next best solution is to use a combination of software that complement one another.

Anti-hacking software, as you will discover below, are programs that are not only compatible with whatever antivirus or security solution that you may be using, they are come with unique features that cover your system with an additional layer of protection and give you a little extra piece of mind.

## Types of Anti-Hacking software

Just like regular security solutions, there is a small array of anti-hacking software available on the market. Programs that offer features and options to keep an eye out for suspicious and mistrustful activities on your computer.

These activities can range from dubious programs phoning home, to applications deploying malicious code on your PC or laptop that is hard to remove.

Some of these apps provide real-time protection against malicious activities, and are a great way to stop malware in its track. This basically means that these programs scan all incoming traffic from various sources to ensure that whatever data that is transferred on your network is safe.

Others are simpler, and focused on specific tasks, or better at certain types of protection and detection. Others still are meant for the enterprise.

That being said, you need to be careful when downloading programs that claim to offer security for your system. For some are actually spyware, designed to hack and steal your data. These applications can actually drop the guard of your system, leaving your seriously vulnerable.

Moral of the story is that you should only always use security solutions from reliable providers. That is to say, developers with a proven track record.

## Best Anti-Hacking software

We have examined a range of different brands that promise to offer the best anti-hacking capabilities on the market. These applications help you detect suspicious files and codes that may be residing on your system, and contributing to hacking attempts and other vicious cyberattacks.

Many of these solutions are free, or come with free features. Other require you to pay for advanced or real-time protection or firewall fortification. In any case, it is very much worth it that you try out a few of these programs before settling on the ones that you feel provide the best defense.

More so, because not all the applications listed below are focused on finding and removing malicious software. There are some handy tools and utilities in this list as well that can aid you in protecting all your devices, all your systems, and all your networks from hacking attempts.

All that said, let’s finally get down to the list.

### Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection

With cyberattacks increasing in sophistication, Microsoft had little choice but to step up its game when it came to the baseline security apparatus in its operating system. With Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection, Microsoft has finally made it into the big league.

What makes this one special is that Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection has all the features you need to detect, investigate, and respond to advanced attacks on your system. Being built on existing Windows 10 security defenses means that it provides a better post-breach layer of protection. 

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/atp.png)

Currently available for Windows 10 Enterprise, Windows 10 Enterprise for Education, Windows 10 Pro, Windows 10 Pro Education, this solution is expected to be made available for all Windows 10 users in the near future. Insiders are currently hard at work testing its capabilities out.

Now, admittedly, this is not something that everyone will pick up and play with. But in time these capabilities will be simplified so that end users are not only protected but can better manage their protection as well. As things stand, this is about as good as it gets for professionals and pros.

### Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit

If you plan on getting serious against hacking attempts on your system, then the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) is very much worth a look. It can really help you raise the bar against attackers that may be trying to gain access to your computer.

Microsoft has made this tool available for free, and you can use it to secure every file on your computer by tuning things up. The program is also compatible with the most commonly used third-party applications meant for home and enterprise use.

![Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/emet.png)

In many ways a gold standard, EMET works by anticipating the most common techniques that adversaries might be using to compromise a system. It then helps keep you on the safe side by diverting, terminating, blocking and invalidating those actions.

This allows you to not only protect against regular hack attempts, but also safeguards your computer systems before new and undiscovered threats are addressed by security updates and antivirus apps. You can go as far as to say that this is one of the closest you will get to a dedicated anti-hacking solution.

| Pros                                                                                                          | **Cons**                                   |

### Adaware Antivirus

Think of Adaware Antivirus as an antivirus, but with a selection of some advance features that help fortify your system against hacking attempts. The tool is powerful enough to remove malware and adware, but it goes way beyond this.

Adaware was developed exclusively as a program to protect against intrusive ads and web trackers. It has been at it since 1999\. But though the application has seen ups and downs, the newest version is capable enough to tackle the modern form of viruses, spyware, and ransomware.

![Adaware Antivirus](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/adawre.png)

The free version offers real-time protection to ensure that you are always protected against the most recent threats. And with download protection built-in, you get the ability to scan all downloads before they have a chance to act funny and damage your PC.

It is also one of the better-designed security solutions, with a clean and crisp UI. Adaware is also very quiet and extremely lightweight. It doesn’t slow down your computer or consume unnecessary resources.

| Pros                                                               | **Cons**                                         |

### Spybot Search & Destroy

A longstanding suite of security tools, Spybot Search & Destroy has been at it for decades. As a result, you get a whole array of features and capabilities that can be put to good use to protect against hacks. Better yet, you also get a free edition of this powerful program to get started.

The party starts with spyware, and you can use this application to find and remove all manner of adware, tracking software, and keyloggers that may have found a house on your system. You also get some really solid immunization capabilities that can help block many a common threat.

![Spybot Search & Destroy](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/spybot.png)

You also get a rootkit scanner that can scan for malware that hides itself and its actions from you and system processes. And a handy startup tool included with Spybot Search & Destroy lets you manage what gets loaded when you turn on your PC.

Of course, the free version of Spybot Search & Destroy misses out on other premium features that are part of the paid editions. But on the flip side, it is possible to run this app alongside Windows Defender by disabling its live protection and then turning off Windows Defender occasionally to manually scan.

| Pros                                                                                                                       | **Cons**                             |

### SUPERAntiSpyware

Weirdly named, SUPERAntiSpyware is another capable solution that offers a selection of anti-hacking capabilities. Better yet, its free version is also a solid shout, save for the fact that you will have to do manual scans and will not get real-time protection from active threats.

[10 Tools to Scan Website for Malware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)

But in terms of features, you get all you need to scan for and remove adware, trojans, worms, keyloggers, and hijackers that have infested your system. The program does a good job of finding out hidden malware and spyware that may be residing on your PC.

![SUPERAntiSpyware](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/superantispyware.png)

You also get a separate section of system tools here that can be used to explore and repair your system. These include the ability to fix registry repair caused by malware, delete capabilities to remove difficult to remove files and folders, and quarantine to manage detected infections.

Getting back to the free version, you also miss out on automatic updates, and will have to manually check for and install the definitions. But if you suspect hacking attempts that are targeted via spyware, then SUPERAntiSpyware remains a great choice to tackling these threats head on.

| Pros                                                        | **Cons**                                                                |

### Trojan Remover

Trojans, as their name gives away, can be extremely sneaky. And these are what hackers often use to gain access to your system. What makes things even more worrisome is that removal of these complex threats is not at all easy — it requires a system-level operation to remove backdoors and rootkits.

This is why Trojan Remover is an ideal solution to get rid of any malware and trojans you might pick up on your system. This user-friendly application is very much at ease with finding and dealing with an extensive array of such advanced threats.

Key features of this program include the detection of elusive trojan, malware, and other potentially unwanted programs in running processes. A simple and straightforward cleanup process helps you get rid of these threats on your system and keep your PC clean and your data secure.

In terms of power, this tool is a fair bit more capable of detecting advanced rootkit techniques than standard antivirus tools. Download the application for yourself and take it for a test run to see how it detects malicious code on your device that you may be suspicious is causing trouble.

| Pros                                                                         | **Cons**                              |

### Ghostpress

Keylogging is an old technique employed by hackers to catch all your keystrokes and then use them to figure out your usernames and passwords, credit card details and more. Cybercriminals basically have an easy way into your system and your connected life.

Ghostpress is a lightweight and reliable utility that is well worth having installed on your system if you use it to handle sensitive information. Say on your home PC where you do your banking transactions or your work laptop that goes with you wherever you go.

![Ghostpress](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ghostpress.png)

This is basically an anti-keylogger that hides keyboard activity. The program not only hides all your keypresses and keyboard strokes that you enter, it also comes with a few neat features like process protection and the ability to prevent hook overwriting.

In short, this is one of the best ways to prevent keyloggers and malicious software from gathering your sensitive information, which is one of their primary approaches that lead to the complete hacking of your system. The application itself is very easy to use, unobtrusive and fully portable.

### Anti-Hacker

It may not seem like much, at least from its user interface, but Anti-Hacker is a solid way to make your computer hacker-proof in just a few mouse clicks. And this it does by bringing a range of useful features to the table that few other programs offer. It’s also a freeware to boot!

For starters, you can use it to disable vulnerabilities in lower accounts that allows them to run programs in administrator modes. It also turns your User Account Control on its highest settings, while a startup scanner and the firewall scanner module get you up to speed with any leaks.

An anti-keylogger is also built into the latest version of this program, and it comes equipped with a virtual keyboard that prevents cybercriminals from logging your sensitive information. And if you are worried about privacy threats, then simply scan for them from their own tab, and apply the fixes.

Overall, this is a great security tool that is highly recommended for experienced users and those that have the security of their computing experiences paramount. Its simpler UI is a bit of a letdown, though, as it makes this an application that needs to be handled with care.

## Conclusion

Hacking is a constant threat for all Internet users, every system that is connected to the web or a network. This is a menace that can have dire consequences for organizations, and significant headaches for home users.

Worse yet, even with advanced security measures in place, hacking remains as threatening as ever, as the various news stories illustrate. Your only real defense against hacking attempts is to fortify your system with security tools and programs that can identify and protect against hacks.

Run these alongside your regular antivirus to remain ever vigilant.

Is SD a reputable company? Out of Toronto. They sell antihacking software and recommend monthly check-in for remote work to “clean up computer”.
