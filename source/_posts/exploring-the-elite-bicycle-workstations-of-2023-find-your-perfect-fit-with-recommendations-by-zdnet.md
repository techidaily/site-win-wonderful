And yet, it can be hard to get dressed and commute to the gym, especially after a long day of work -- but desk bikes are an excellent solution. Instead of remaining stationary for hours on end, you can pedal under your desk while you work on that project or draft a promotion-worthy email -- all while staying in place.

Cycling is a low-impact form of cardio that can be easier on the joints compared to running. You don't have to train for a triathlon, but cycling a few miles can be a great habit that you won't immediately grow sick of. Plus, it's best to set attainable goals and accomplish small wins throughout your day. A bike desk allows you to habit stack your work and fitness by combining cardio with productivity.

## How did we choose these bike desks?

I'm a remote worker who likes being active and staying fit, and I know other people must be in the same boat. I read about how Hootsuite remodeled the Vancouver office and incorporated bike desks and treadmill desks into the design. I figured the same could be replicated for remote workers.

When I began researching the best bike desks, having ample desk space and a quiet biking experience were at the top of my priority list. I approached products as a customer, not just someone with a cursory interest. I researched the best bikes and found some great options to help others incorporate activity seamlessly into their work schedule.

After hours of poring over specs and reviews, I found the top five bike desks so we can all prioritize activity and make sure professional success doesn't come at the expense of physical health. Bike desks are one means to that end. 

## What is a bike desk?

A bike desk has a cycling component and a desk component that are oftentimes connected on one machine, or broken apart for customizability. You can also easily add a DeskCycle under your current desk, and voila! Your own bike desk. If you wanted a unified machine, you should go for another option on this list.

## What are the benefits of desk bikes?

Biking is aerobic exercise that benefits your heart, blood vessels, and lungs. It can be great for improving your overall fitness. Regular physical activity has been linked to lower stress and body fat levels. A bike desk takes a sedentary work day and spins it into something physically productive.
