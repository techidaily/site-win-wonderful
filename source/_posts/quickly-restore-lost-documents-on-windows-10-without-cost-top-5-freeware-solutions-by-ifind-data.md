Recovering lost files on Windows 10 is an easy process. Follow these simple steps:

* Press the Windows key on your computer. Then enter and select Windows File Recovery.
* In the Command Prompt window, enter a command like this: winfr source-drive: destination-drive: \[mode\] \[/switches\]

You can recover deleted files in Windows 10 without downloading or installing third-party software. You can do this by restoring files from the recycle bin:

* Enter the recycle bin by clicking the recycle bin icon on your desktop.
* Deleted files will appear here if you haven’t been here before and clicked the Delete key. Select the desired files.
* You can also drag desired files from the recycle bin into whatever folder you want.

If you are looking for a quality software solution, we highly recommend iFinD Data Recovery Software.
