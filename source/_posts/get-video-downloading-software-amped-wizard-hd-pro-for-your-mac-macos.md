## Get Video Downloading Software: Amped Wizard HD Pro - For Your Mac, macOS

### Overview

Download Accelerator Plus (DAP) is a download manager which can download online videos at faster speed than other download managers by splitting the files into small pieces. Besides DAP features automatic mirror speed boost which enables DAP to search for the fastest download sources.

**DAP has three versions for now:**

* **Standard version:** it's also a free version and you can only have 4 channel acceleration of your downloads.
* **Premium version:** it's also a commercial version and you can get 10 channel acceleration which means Premium version is more fast than Standard version, but Premium version is not a free one.
* **Mac version:** it's also a Trialware and is not as stable as Standard version and Premium version with respect of function. **What's worse**, Mac version can only support Mac OS 10.2/10.3, that is, DAP Mac version can't support later Mac OS version than Mac OS 10.3, such as Mac OS 10.6 or later. **And worse still**, unlike Standard version and Premium version, DAP Mac version can only support browsers including: Internet Explorer 5.x | 6.x; Opera 5 | 6; Safari 1.0 | 1.2; Netscape 6.x | 7.x; Mozilla which means DAP Mac version can't work with almost all leading browsers like Internet Explorer 7.x | 8.x| 9.x, Chrome, FireFox, or Opera 8|9\. To some extent, DAP Mac version is out of date which can't keep pace with the update of Mac operation system or browsers.

**Don't be upset. To experience the DAP fast downloading and other features, the Mac users can choose to install and use a Download Accelerator Plus for Mac alternative for which purpose Allavsoft is a good option.**
